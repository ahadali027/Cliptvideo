    "question": "How many videos can my editor make?",
    "answer": "These are great editors, so they work fast. Exact times depend on a lot of factors – particularly how much footage there is and how many motion graphics are requested.but once you start working with your editor you’ll get a good sense for each other’s workflow and speed. You can work together to dial things in from there.Also, if you provide them with asset databases like Envato Elements, Storyblocks, etc. they’ll be able to work much faster."
